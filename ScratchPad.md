# SAP GUI NOTES:

## Objects

vugen is able to find the objects. for vugen anything there is in vugen is object. everything is an object. for vugen to do anything in vugen it has to identify objects.for example: btn1
when you highlight the icon/button the name appears.

every object has a name and vugen will identify with the name.

## control Ids
internally this object has control id. every object on the sap will have control id.


like every house has a address.

thousands of objects- if vugen has to identify the particular object it has to know the address of the house/object which is called control ids.

control id- address of the object called "save'

vugen treats every single thing in the screen as objects.everything you see is an object.


vugen assign control id's to each of these objects.


Once it is assigned it will go and identify those objects using the control ids 

Since the control ids can be really big in lr_strings.h is assigned to as a string variables and it is calling it as objects.and it is using the objects in script-shel112

will my script work, if i use control id's directly in the script?

## Enable scripting on the SAP Application Server

1. Open transaction rz11. 

Specify the parameter name sapgui/user_scripting and click Display.

The Display Profile Parameter Attributes window opens.

2. If Profile Val is FALSE, you need to modify its value. 

Click the Change value button in the toolbar. The Change Parameter 

Value window opens. Enter TRUE in the ProfileVal box and click 

the Save button.

3. Restart the application server to apply your changes.

## Enable scripting on SAP GUI client

During installation. While installing the SAP GUI client, enable the SAP GUI Scripting option.

## Replay SAP GUI Scripts

Replace Masked Password
For additional security, you can mask the password within the code. Right-click in the password text (the actual text, not *****) and select Mask String. VuGen inserts an lr_unmask function at the location of the password as follows:

sapgui_logon("user", lr_unmask("3ea037b758"), "800", "EN");

## Save Date Information

lr_save_datetime

```
lr_save_datetime("%d.%m.%Y", DATE_NOW + (2 * ONE_DAY),            

  "paramDateTodayPlus2");
sapgui_set_text("Req. deliv.date", 
        "{paramDateTodayPlus2}",
        "usr/ctxtRV45A-KETDAT", 
        BEGIN_OPTIONAL, 
            "AdditionalInfo=sapgui1025", 
        END_OPTIONAL);
```

## Retrieve Information

```
sapgui_status_bar_get_type

sapgui_status_bar_get_param
  ```

sapgui_status_bar_get_param function saves the order number 

into a user-defined parameter. In this case, the order number is 

the second index of the status bar string.

```
sapgui_press_button("Save (Ctrl+S)", 
    "tbar[0]/btn[11]", 
    BEGIN_OPTIONAL, 
        "AdditionalInfo=sapgui1038", 
    END_OPTIONAL);
sapgui_status_bar_get_type("Status");
if(0==strcmp(lr_eval_string("{Status}"),"Success"))
  sapgui_status_bar_get_param("2", " Order_Number ");
  ```


## Add Verification Functions

```
sapgui_is_object_available

if (!sapgui_is_object_available("wnd[1]"))
        sapgui_call_method("{ButtonID}", 
            "press", 
            LAST, 
            AdditionalInfo=info1011");
sapgui_press_button(.....)
```

# Performance Analysis -Looking into Metrics Using T- Codes 

## Performance Analysis Using SAP Transaction codes.

### ST02 : Memory/Buffer Management 

#### What is Buffer?

SAP stores frequently used information in buffers in memory.

Transaction ST02 monitors the usage of these buffers.

The most critical factors it reports are hit ratio, free spaces and swaps.

#### Hit Ratio: 

The hit ratio is the percentage of request that can be fulfilled by the information in each buffer (preventing expensive database requests), and perhaps is the most important statistic on the screen.

Note: The higher the hit ratio is the better it is.
The Hit Ratio of the single record buffer increases very slowly from system startup: therefore, a hit ratio less than 90% is a concern only if there is no free space left in the buffer.

#### Free Space

Free space measures how full the buffer is.

#### Swap

Swaps show how many times data had to be removed from the buffer to make room for other data.

### Interview Question:

What are the bottleneck that you have seen while doing sapgui?

I have monitored using ST02 and the hit ratio was less than 90% and there was no free space and definitely this was a concern and this is a bottleneck which i reported to the developer.

*Example NFR:*

```
Table:

Parameter      NFR        Desc
Hit Ratio      >95%       Percentage of requests filled by SAP buffer (memory) and not disk.
Free Space     >5%        Unused space percentage in each buffer.
Swaps          >3         No of times an object was swapped from a buffer to make room of another object.
```

https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/loadrunner/loadrunner-scripting-challenges/


# LoadRunner VuGen

## Steps To Record In VuGen:

- Open the VuGen.

- Select the Protocol.

- Provide a script name , Location , Solution Name, Solution Target 

- Click on Create.

- New Page Opens

- Add as many actions you need for the scenario and Edit the appropriate name for the actions or you can record in 1 action and later on you can create multiple actions and copy and paste/ move actions around.

- There is no hard and fast rule as to whether you have to put all the login in init and logoff in end. It's up to you.

- Cick on record button/click on record and click record  or use shortcut key CTRL + R

- Dialogue box opens 

- Select all the preferences and enter info. 

- Click on Start Recording.

- Recording dialogue box opens and the application where you perform the actions.

- Start performing the actions by commenting each action/ by giving start end transaction name and  by putting into right actions.

- After you are done stop the recording.

- Design studio dialog opens.

- Close the Design studio and you will see the actual recording/codes.

# Resourses of functions

# Drodown Correlation

web_reg_save_param_ex using ORD = ALL

In the web reg save param there are various arguments.
As a Performance Tester for the web reg save param ex fiction you have given  LB and RB with Ordinal = ALL to VuGen.

web reg save param ex will go the response grab the dynamic value in-between LB and RB and will put into a LR Parameter. Not only that it will also grab the similar dynamic value which is in-between LB and RB.dynamic value 2 and put it into LR Parameter.

now LR Parameter will store lot of values.

now the LR Parameter is not storing 1 value it it storing multiple values.

This is why we now call this LR Parameter as Array.only one parameter storing multiple values.

agenda:
========
1. Select one random Departure city from the drop down list.
Using ordinal= ALL , pull out all the departure cities     >>> array will be created.
2. From this array list, pick one value randomly and use this as a Departure City.
================================================= 


First you need to correlate the value "Depart."

```
********************************************** 
web_reg_save_param_ex("ParamName=Dept_City",
"LB=<option value=\"",
"RB=\">",
"Ordinal= ALL",
LAST);
*********************************************** 
```
First agenda is doneâ€¦

now parameter value has to be randomly selected from this array. use this function for this.


lr_paramarr_ramdom("Dept_City");

i will be able to pick up a value randomly from this parameter called  Dept_City.

*****************************************
what is the input for this ? Dept_City

what is the output for this? String is the output for this.

how do you know this? 

go to functions in roadrunner.select hit f1

char *lr_paramarr_random(const char * paramArrayName);

What is the input for this? paramArrayName

what is the output for this? string char *

how the string should be declared ? char * should be declared as a pointer.

***************************************** 

now lr_paramarr_ramdom("Dept_City"); becomes

Random_Dept_City=lr_paramarr_ramdom("Dept_City");

now inside the global.h global variable

declare

``` 
char *Random_Dept_City;
```

now what happens from this array list one value will be picked up randomly from Dept_City which is holding 18 values and will be stored in Random_Dept_City.

lets see what value it has picked up? for this either you have to put lr output message or see in watch 

it has picked up san francisco. try more iterations.

now this Random_Dept_City variable will be holding some values.


no this randomly selected value needs to be passed in here(web request where it is depart)

now instead of denver put {"Random_Dept_City"} with curly braces. 

i am doing this because Random_Dept_City is holding a random value.

now tell me what is Random_Dept_City ? string , integers or float? 

it is a string. 

can i put string as an LR String as an input?

no. this web_submit data LR Functions only accepts LR Parameter. no strings, no inters, no float

now there is a need to convert this string Random_Dept_City into LR Parameter.

for this we can use : lr_save_string

lr_save_string("Random_Dept_City","pRandom_Dept_City");

conversion from string to LR Parameter is done.

now pass this value pRandom_Dept_City to web submit data with curly braces.{pRandom_Dept_City}.

instead of lr_save_string you can also use 

lr_param_sprintf("pRandom_Dept_City ", %s , "Random_Dept_City ");

now we need to pick up random city from arrival city also . since both have same values or are same you do not have to correlation again. or need to build web reg save param.

from the same Dept_City array - web reg save param pick one random city.

now change the parameter name:City

```
web_reg_save_param_ex("ParamName=City",
"LB=<option value=\"",
"RB=\">",
"Ordinal= ALL",
LAST);
```
declare

char *Random_Arrival_City;

Random_Arrival_City=lr_paramarr_ramdom("Arrival_City");

lr_save_string("pRandom_Arrival_City","Random_Arrival_City");

now pass this value pRandom_Arrival_City to web submit data with curly braces.{pRandom_Arrival_City}.

now it will pick random cities for both departure and arrival city.

# Example of extended RB to new line
```
web_reg_save_param_ex(

"ParamName=User_Session",
"LB=<option value=\"",
"RB=\">\n table border",
"Ordinal= ALL",
LAST);
```

# Understanding of What LG means in LoadRunner

1) LG is software which si avaiable with the loadrunner package. You have to identify a machine or server to install this LG software. Once the LG software is installed on a certain machine, we can call it as LG machine

2) We can hav as many LG machines as possible depending on your need. Maximum i have seen is 30 LG's

3) I have seen projects where performance testers created their own LG's and in bigger organizations, HP team (Now Microfocus team) usually do the installations. If you are given responsibility to create these LG's, you can take help of HP team. They are usually good with customer service

4) Once LG is created, you need to connect to these LG's from the controller


# Thread vs Process

Run Vuser As A Thread

Running Vuser as a thread will be more effective on keeping OS resources consumption on the injector's boxes to considerably low as this setting does not  have very heavy footprints.

Run Vuser As Process

Running user as process will be very heavy on OS resources consumption on the injector boxes.

Run Vuser As A Thread

As multiple threads running within a single process share the available resources among themselves, its recommended to use this setting when huge number of users are required to run on the injector boxes.


Run Vuser As Process

As each vsuer has its own process and privately allocated resources, it's not recommended to use this setting when huge number of vusers are are required to run on the injector boxes.
