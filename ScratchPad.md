# SAP GUI NOTES:

## Objects

vugen is able to find the objects. for vugen anything there is in vugen is object. everything is an object. for vugen to do anything in vugen it has to identify objects.for example: btn1
when you highlight the icon/button the name appears.

every object has a name and vugen will identify with the name.

## control Ids
internally this object has control id. every object on the sap will have control id.


like every house has a address.

thousands of objects- if vugen has to identify the particular object it has to know the address of the house/object which is called control ids.

control id- address of the object called "save'

vugen treats every single thing in the screen as objects.everything you see is an object.


vugen assign control id's to each of these objects.


Once it is assigned it will go and identify those objects using the control ids 

Since the control ids can be really big in lr_strings.h is assigned to as a string variables and it is calling it as objects.and it is using the objects in script-shel112

will my script work, if i use control id's directly in the script?
